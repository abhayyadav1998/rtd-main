# Networking Basics:

Let's forget the DevOps side of things to begin with here and we now need to look very briefly into some of the Networking fundamentals.
## Network Devices 
Host are any devices which send or receive traffic.

IP Address the identity of each host.

Network is what transports traffic between hosts. If we did not have networks there would be a lot of manual movement of data!

A logical group of hosts which require similar connectivity.

Switches facilitate communication within a network. A switch forwards data packets between hosts. A switch sends packets directly to hosts.
- Network: A Grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity.
- Hosts on a Network share the same IP address space.
 
Routers facilitate communication between networks. If we said before that a switch looks after communication within a network a router allows us to join these networks together or at least give them access to each other if permitted.
A router can provide a traffic control point (security, filtering, redirecting) More and more switches also provide some of these functions now.
Routers learn which networks they are attached to. This is known as routes, a routing table is all the networks a router knows about.
A router has an IP address in the networks they are attached to. This IP is also going to be each host's way out of their local network also known as a gateway.
Routers also create the hierarchy in networks I mentioned earlier.

## Switches vs Routers
Routing is the process of moving data between networks.
- A router is a device whose primary purpose is Routing.
Switching is the process of moving data within networks.
- A Switch is a device whose primary purpose is switching.

This is very much a foundational overview of devices as we know there are many different Network Devices such as:
- Access Points
- Firewalls
- Load Balancers
- Layer 3 Switches
- IDS / IPS
- Proxies
- Virtual Switches
- Virtual Routers

Although all of these devices are going to perform Routing and/or Switching.
