# Study cloud design. (Data Management, Design, and Implementation)

A good cloud design starts with an assessment of your existing workloads and business needs.

Before you can design your cloud, you must first assess your existing environment and business needs. Here are just some of the questions your team will need to explore:

- What are your existing workloads and applications? Where do they currently run, and who uses them?
- How is your overall cloud utilization? Is it lower than it should be because it was designed to accommodate peak loads? Do you need to scale up to support new workloads?
- Are you running into any bottlenecks in compute performance, memory, or networking?
-What does your virtualization environment look like? Are you using containers?
- How will you ensure resiliency? Should this involve using multiple cloud service providers?
