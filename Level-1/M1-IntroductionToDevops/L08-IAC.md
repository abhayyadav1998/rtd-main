# Understand Infrastructure as Code. 

#### What is the use of IAC ?
Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is a method to provision and manage IT infrastructure through the use of source code, rather than through standard operating procedures and manual processes

CloudFormation and Terraform are provisioning tools, which means they are designed to provision the servers themselves (as well as the rest of our infrastructure, like load balancers, databases, networking configuration, etc)
