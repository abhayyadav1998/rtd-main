#### What is Grafana and Prometheus?

Prometheus is a monitoring solution for storing time series data like metrics. Grafana allows to visualize the data stored in Prometheus (and other sources). 

#### Is CloudWatch a monitoring tool?

#### What is Loki and Promtail?

Promtail is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private Grafana Loki instance or Grafana Cloud. It is usually deployed to every machine that has applications needed to be monitored. 

#### What is Nagios tool used for?

Nagios is an open source monitoring system for computer systems. It was designed to run on the Linux operating system and can monitor devices running Linux, Windows and Unix operating systems (OSes). Nagios software runs periodic checks on critical parameters of application, network and server resources.

#### What is Datadog tool used for?
Datadog is a monitoring and analytics tool for information technology (IT) and DevOps teams that can be used to determine performance metrics as well as event monitoring for infrastructure and cloud services. The software can monitor services such as servers, databases and tools.

#### What is New Relic used for ?

New Relic is a Software as a Service offering that focuses on performance and availability monitoring. It uses a standardized Apdex (application performance index) score to set and rate application performance across the environment in a unified manner.

#### What is Sentry ?

Sentry is a crash reporting platform that provides you with "real-time insight into production deployments with info to reproduce and fix crashes". It notifies you of exceptions or errors that your users run into while using your app, and organizes them for you on a web dashboard.

- It is good to know and have done hands on Grafana, Prometheus, Promtail agent, Loki 
- Must have experience with CloudWatch 
- Optionally as per project or client requirement we can work on Nagios, Datadog, New Relic, Sentry and other monitoring tools
